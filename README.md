# Smart-Grid-Stability-ML
 This project predicts smart grid stability using machine learning to address challenges from renewable energy integration. We compare models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost using the Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Dataset. XGBoost achieves over 99% accuracy, making it essential for enhancing grid reliability and resilience.
